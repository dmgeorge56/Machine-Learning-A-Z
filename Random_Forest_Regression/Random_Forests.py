##Random Forests Intuition Notes
##applied to regression trees
##ensemble learning:
    ##when you take multiple algorithms and put 
    ##them together to make something more powerful
    ##than the original
##get multiple predictions and take the average
##of the predictions over all of the trees
##reminds him of:
        ##take a guess how many m&ms are in the jar
        ##best way to beat that game is
        ##get a pen and paper and stand next to
        ##the person that takes the guesses
        ##take the average of all the guesses
        ##by everyone else
        ##you have more statistical power doing this
        ##than by guessing alone
##Random forest = a team of decision trees
